{"body":"# Artisan bundle for Laravel\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis bundle exposes artisan to the web. As such, it probably should not be used in a production environment. You can password protect it, I guess, but it's still risky. I wrote it primarily to use migrations in a PHP Fog app, where it also worked nicely for running tasks to generate test data.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n#### Add something like this to ```application/bundles.php```:\r\n\r\n    return array(\r\n    \t'artisan' => array(\r\n    \t\t'handles' => 'artisan',\r\n    \t),\r\n    );\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nUse URLs like artisan tasks, replacing spaces with ```/```, double colons (```::```) with ```+```, and colons (```:```) with ```.```.\r\n\r\nFor example, the migrate command\r\n\r\n    php artisan migrate\r\n\r\nbecomes\r\n\r\n    http://my.awesome.app/artisan/migrate\r\n\r\nand the task\r\n\r\n    php artisan admin::generate:list\r\n\r\nwould be\r\n\r\n    http://my.awesome.app/artisan/admin+generate.list\r\n\r\nParameters are allowed too.\r\n\r\n    php artisan notify someone\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n    http://my.awesome.app/artisan/notify/someone\r\n\r\n## Enjoy\r\n\r\nI hope someone else finds this useful at some point.","tagline":"A bundle to expose `artisan` to the web","note":"Don't delete this file!
